This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


``` {r message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)

limpetdata = read.csv('./data/limpet.csv')
str(limpetdata)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

![possum](possumgif.gif)

```{r}
ggplot(limpetdata, aes(x=DENSITY, y=EGGS, colour=SEASON))+
  geom_point(size=5, alpha=0.5)
```
